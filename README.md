# 2hats_gym
This is app is already uploaded to Google App Engine, which has URL as "https://buoyant-yew-252813.appspot.com"
<br/> I wrote several test code in `2hats_gym/module/test.js`, you don't need use `npm start` to create a server at your local machine, 
 you can just go straight to my test code, and add more test as you like, then just implement `node test.js` and check the result.
<br/> Thank you!
